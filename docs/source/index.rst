===========================
 *PyBERT* Developer's Guide
===========================

Note to PyBERT *users*
----------------------

The documentation for the *PyBERT* project has 2 parts:

* help for stand-alone GUI application *users*, and
* help for PyBERT *developers* and *importers*

This is the help for developers and importers.

If you're looking for usage instructions, you're in the wrong place.
Instead, try:

* Looking at the *Help* tab of the PyBERT GUI.
* Looking at the `PyBERT FAQ <https://github.com/capn-freako/PyBERT/wiki/pybert_faq>`_.
* Sending me e-mail at: <capn.freako@gmail.com>.

Note to PyBERT *importers*
--------------------------

If you are importing PyBERT functionality into a larger body of work, this *is* the right place for you, since it provides:

- module, class, and attribute definitions and specifications of intent, and
- calling signatures for module/class member functions.
