The `*.pyi` files contained herein were generated, using the following command:

    stubgen -o type_stubs PyAMI/src/

executed from within the `PyBERT/` directory.

Note, however, that the resultant output required some manual editing before things worked correctly.
So, this is probably not a good candidate for automatic generation, via make, etc.
